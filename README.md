# Estimation of Blur
The blurring effect of an image is represented by the point spread function(PSF). Estimation of PSF has a very important role in removing motion from blurred images and can lead to the improvement of the optical resolution of a camera. The estimation is done by looking for specific characteristics of the original image, such as the pixels on the contour, from which the blurring effect can be identified and estimated. The test image was blurred with a known PSF, which was estimated. The accuracy of the estimate is given by the signal-to-noise ratio(SNR), where the result obtained is 22.02dB, which is a good result.
