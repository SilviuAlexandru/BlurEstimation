# Estimation of Blur
The blurring effect of an image is represented by the point spread function(PSF). Estimation of PSF has a very important role in removing motion from blurred images and can lead to the improvement of the optical resolution of a camera. The estimation is done by looking for specific characteristics of the original image, such as the pixels on the contour, from which the blurring effect can be identified and estimated.
